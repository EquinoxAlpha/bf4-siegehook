# bf4-siegehook

A cheat for Battlefield 4.

Internal, uses ImGui for drawing.

Has some basic screenshot blocking, not tested for long enough.

## Using
* Compile the solution in Visual Studio
* Inject using any DLL injector

## Features
* Wallhack, can differentiate between players, vehicles and explosives.
* Radar
* Aimbot (I don't use it, so not much attention was paid to it)
* Unlock All (attachments & camos, not guns)
* No recoil & No spread

## Credits
The inspirations for this project was from the HyperHook and spankerfield cheats, which are more complete, but I wanted to develop something myself. Some of the code in this project was taken from the 2 mentioned cheats.
